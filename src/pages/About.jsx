      What is BudgetApp? BudgetApp is a Providence, RI-based company that makes
      it easy to split bills with friends and family. We organize all your
      shared expenses and IOUs in one place, so that everyone can see who they
      owe. Whether you are sharing a ski vacation, splitting rent with
      roommates, or paying someone back for lunch, BudgetApp makes life easier.
      We store your data in the cloud so that you can access it anywhere: on
      iPhone, Android, or on your computer. We focus on fairness Most people
      want to be fair to each other, but sometimes they forget, or can’t decide
      on what fair is. In addition to helping people honor their debts, we
      provide mediation advice about fairness issues through our “fairness
      calculators.” These calculators turn our crowdsourced data into a neutral
      fairness opinion about your personal situation.
